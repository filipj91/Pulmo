Model Training Performance Comparison: Google Colab vs Amazon SageMaker

Welcome to a repository that presents a detailed analysis of the training performance of a machine learning model on two popular platforms: Google Colab and Amazon SageMaker.
 This project allows interactive comparison of performance metrics such as accuracy and loss across training epochs.
 The platform is designed to provide transparency into the training process and facilitate analysis of results from both environments.

Project Features
Training Performance Comparison:
Interactive visualizations using Plotly and Dash, allowing you to track changes in model metrics in real time.

Comparison of model accuracy and loss across two different platforms, Google Colab and Amazon SageMaker.

Interactive Dashboard:
A Streamlit-based application that allows you to dynamically view training results.

Users can select metrics (accuracy or loss) and training epochs to get detailed information about the model's performance across training phases.

Advanced Analytics:
Showing the benefits of using the Amazon SageMaker platform, whose infrastructure allows for better optimization of the training process, including lower losses and higher model accuracy.

Summary
The project provides a detailed comparative analysis of the efficiency of model training on the Google Colab and Amazon SageMaker platforms.
 Thanks to the advanced Amazon SageMaker infrastructure, better results were obtained, which was included in the visualizations of metrics such as loss and accuracy.
 The application allows for easy interpretation of results and helps to understand which platform is more optimal in the context of training advanced models.
