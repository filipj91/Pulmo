# Model Training Performance Comparison: Google Colab vs Amazon SageMaker

Welcome to a repository showcasing a detailed analysis of machine learning model training performance on two popular platforms: Google Colab and Amazon SageMaker.  
This project provides an interactive comparison of performance metrics, such as accuracy and loss, across training epochs. The platform is designed to ensure transparency in the training process and to facilitate the analysis of results from both environments.

## Project Features

### Training Performance Comparison
- Interactive visualizations built with Plotly and Dash, allowing real-time tracking of model metric changes.
- Comparison of model accuracy and loss across two platforms: Google Colab and Amazon SageMaker.

### Interactive Dashboard
- A Streamlit-based application that enables dynamic exploration of training results.
- Users can select metrics (accuracy or loss) and specific training epochs to get detailed insights into the model's performance across different phases of training.

### Advanced Analytics
- Highlights the advantages of using Amazon SageMaker, whose advanced infrastructure allows for better optimization of the training process, including lower loss and higher model accuracy.

## Summary
This project delivers a detailed comparative analysis of model training efficiency on the Google Colab and Amazon SageMaker platforms.  
Thanks to Amazon SageMaker's advanced infrastructure, better results were achieved, as reflected in visualizations of metrics like loss and accuracy.  
The application simplifies result interpretation and helps identify which platform is more optimal for training advanced machine learning models.
